                            Kranthi Das, from the age of 20, has been a part of the customer care industry. Interacting with customers and understanding their mood, which varies as per the situation, made her think to start something that would help customer satisfaction and help them make easy interactions through chat rather than voice. <br /> <br />

Since 2015, she has been an active member of human welfare and animal welfare organizations & communities. As a Team lead of Motopaws, an organization funded by Ratan Tata, she organized and made herself available to numerous campaigns in Visakhapatnam and Bangalore to put radium collars on stray dogs to avoid them coming under speeding vehicles. She also motivates and councils acid attack survivors, rape victims, and child beggars. She conducted many social educative drives to educate kids about sex abuse and women about domestic violence. These strengthened them with the awareness of how they can help and stay positive within themselves. Without raising funds, she organized campaigns to distribute sanitary napkins to girls and pee napkins to children in slums, which adds to her reformation activities list. 
<br /><br />
With establishing her dream project, UNATHI technologies, she started empowering women. She put in much effort to educate and provide them employment, especially those who gave up their careers after giving birth to babies. It aims for women to make a career after the break.
